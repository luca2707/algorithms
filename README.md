## Algorithmic exercices

This repository holds a set of short python scripts that implement simple algorithms.
I created these to prepare myself for an job interview.
The original exercice is defined in french, but I wrote all the comments in my code in french.

I am a beginner in python, do not expect advanced stuff.

For the first exercices, I used an interactive mode, i.e. the scripts prompts for input on stdin and produces some output on sdtout.
Debugging information is just printed out also on stdout.

In later exercices I started using the **logging** package to properly log debugging information,
and started implementing unit tests using the **unittest** package.
